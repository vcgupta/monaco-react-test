I wanted to make Monaco Editor work with Electron. Tried following three packages till now and each of them is having some issue. It doesn't work:

1. "@monaco-editor/react"

Error appear as in screenshot/1.react-monaco-editor error 
2. Same error appears from monaco-editor-electorn package

3. With following setup also it throws loadForeignModule error:

"monaco-editor-webpack-plugin": "^2.0.0",
 "react-monaco-editor": "^0.40.0",
